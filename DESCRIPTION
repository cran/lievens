Description: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) data
    sets by Lievens et al. (2012) <doi:10.1093/nar/gkr775>. Provides one
    single tabular tidy data set in long format, encompassing three
    dilution series, targeted against the soybean Lectin endogene. Each dilution
    series was assayed in one of the following PCR-efficiency-modifying
    conditions: no PCR inhibition, inhibition by isopropanol and inhibition by
    tannic acid. The inhibitors were co-diluted along with the dilution series.
    The co-dilution series consists of a five-point, five-fold serial dilution.
    For each concentration there are 18 replicates. Each amplification
    curve is 60 cycles long. Original raw data file is available at the 
    Supplementary Data section at Nucleic Acids Research Online <doi:10.1093/nar/gkr775>.
